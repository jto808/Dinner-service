Prepping is an action applying to nothing.

The prepping action has an object called the Substance.
app, dinner, and dessert are edible things. [not that you'll be eating them!]

Setting action variables for prepping:
	let X be a list of objects;
	repeat with item running through things on plate:
		add item to X;
	sort X;
	repeat through the Table of Recipes:
		let Y be the ingredient list entry;
		sort Y;
		if X is Y:
			now the Substance is the result entry.
